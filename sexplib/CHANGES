2008-04-24:  Made Sexp-interface manifest.

2008-03-20:  Fixed META-file (missing num dependency).

2008-03-17:  Improved META-file.

2008-03-13:  Fully allow function types in converters.  Raise runtime
             exceptions on converting from S-expressions instead when
             function type encountered.

2008-02-11:  Fixed code generation problems with variance annotations
             in signatures, and empty types.

2007-12-17:  Added support for generating signature entries for
             S-expression converters.  Thanks to Till Varoquaux
             <till.varoquaux@gmail.com> for the patch!

2007-11-29:  Added support for converting big_int, nat, num, and ratio.

2007-11-26:  Added support for parsing from bigstrings (char bigarrays).

2007-11-02:  Added syntax support for option types to use the ordinary
             sum type syntax.  This should improve readability.
             The old syntax will be accepted, too, if
             Conv.read_old_option_format is set to true (this is
             currently the default).  The old format will be used for
             writing if Conv.write_old_option_format is true (currently
             the default).  The old syntax is deprecated and will
             probably not be supported by default in the near future.
             Reading new-style option values will always succeed.

2007-09-14:  Fixed bug in S-expression preprocessor concerning record
             field names.

2007-08-06:  Added support for converting functions to S-expressions.

2007-07-20:  Fixed position information and improved speed of S-expression
             parser.  Fixed S-expression macro bug concerning contained
             polymorphic variants.

2007-06-28:  Improved Sexplib code generation.

2007-06-22:  Fixed escaping bug in S-expression parser.

2007-06-01:  Added correct handling of recursive types + test case.

2007-04-18:  Added missing conversion functions from S-expressions to
             pairs and triples.

2007-03-21:  Updated OCamlMakefile.

2007-03-02:  Improved error messages when parsing illegal type definitions.

2007-01-30:  Added triple conversions.

2006-11-22:  Updated OCamlMakefile.

2006-10-13:  Improved checking of records for extra or duplicate fields.

2006-09-06:  Added support for polymorphic record fields.

2006-09-05:  Added support for manifest types.

2006-08-16:  Improved error messages.

2006-07-28:  Added a new, hand-written S-expression parser that supports
             partial parsing and should be approx. 10x faster than the
             previous one.

2006-06-20:  Fixed a code generation problem leading to compilation
             errors concerning the use of type aliases within polymorphic
             variant type definitions.

             This fix also solves potential erroneous appearances of
             backtracking exceptions in user code.

2006-03-21:  Added -for-pack option to Makefile and cleaned up
             distribution for a new public release.

2006-03-13:  Sexplib now accepts capitalized booleans.

2006-03-03:  Added customizable indentation levels.
             Improved documentation.
             Fixed API-problem concerning backward compatibility.

2006-03-03:  Added customizable indentation levels.
             Improved documentation.

2006-03-01:  Added a missing flush for string conversions with a buffer.

2006-02-08:  Eliminated unused variable warnings in Sexplib-generated code.

2006-01-11:  Added functions for pretty-printing to buffers.  Improved
             performance of outputting S-expressions to channels.

2006-01-09:  Added functions load_sexp and load_sexps.

2006-01-04:  Changed float conversion from %E to %G (more readable).

2005-12-28:  Made machine representation for S-expressions more compact

2005-12-15:  Fixed a problem appearing with OCaml-release 3.08.4:  CamlP4
             obviously performs more strict checking on some constructs
             now and crashed with an exception when generating
             S-expression code for records containing only one field
             ("singleton tuple problem").  This problem is fixed now.

2005-11-25:  Fixed problem with type variables that could not be generalized.

2005-11-23:  Added a missing case in type definitions (path alias)

2005-11-17:  Major release: 2.0

             Fixed a major design problem.  The user now has to pass lex
             buffers instead of channels to input-functions.  Reason:
             trailing characters in channels were lost due to ocamllex
             buffering them in the non-exposed lex buffer.  This lex
             buffer is now exposed.  The functions have been renamed
             ("input_X" -> "scan_X") to reflect this change.

2005-11-16:  Added label to conversion function "input_cnv_sexps".

2005-11-11:  Fixed a bug in the pretty-printer: strings in atoms were
             not escaped in the function "to_string_mach" (and therefore
             also "to_string").

2005-11-07:  Initial release.
