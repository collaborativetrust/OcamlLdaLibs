Packages required: 
 * camlp4
 * camlp4-extra
 * ocaml-findlib

To make for the first time: 

$ make all

You will be asked for the root password, as installation is part of
the make process.  This because some of the packages need, in order to
be built, for previous packages to be already installed. 

To make subsequent times: 

$ make clean
$ make uninstall
$ make all

The "make uninstall" is necessary! 

You can find in the various subdirectories Makefiles that are
perfectly functional, should you wish to build the packages and
install them one by one in the traditional way.
