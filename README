Packages required: 
 * camlp4
 * camlp4-extra
 * ocaml-findlib

To make for the first time, there are two ways. 

1) If you need to be root to install: 

   $ make all-sudo

   You will be asked for the root password, as installation is part of
   the make process.  This because some of the packages need, in order to
   be built, for previous packages to be already installed. 

2) If you can install without being root, as when you are using godi: 

   $ make all


To make subsequent times: 

$ make clean
$ make uninstall[-sudo]
$ make all[-sudo]

The "make uninstall[-sudo]" is necessary! 

You can find in the various subdirectories Makefiles that are
perfectly functional, should you wish to build the packages and
install them one by one in the traditional way.
